Difficulties Encountered:
Importing the Netflix Shows dataset into MySQL Workbench was smooth without any major difficulties. However, one minor challenge I encountered was dealing with missing values in certain columns, which required handling during data analysis.

Interesting Observation:
One interesting thing I noticed about the Netflix Shows dataset is the diversity of genres available. There's a wide range of genres, from drama and comedy to documentaries and reality TV shows, reflecting the diverse content offered by Netflix.
